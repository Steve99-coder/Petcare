    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>There exists a wide variety of pets which can be kept at home for different reasons.
       It all depends where the interest of the person concerned are
    </p>
    <h2>Examples of pets</h2>
    <ul>
        <p><li>Dogs are one of the most affectionate and loyal creatures on earth.
            Dogs don’t care if you are black, Arab, jewish, if you have any physically
            or mental disabilities. They don’t care if you have money, if you are good 
            looking or even if you are smart. They just learn to love you for who you are. 
            Even when things are perfect, even if you neglect them, they are just unconditional
             lovers. They will sense your pain and feel pain with you. Even if you push them 
             away they will always love you. </li>

        <p><li>Cats are an enigma that have captured the hearts of people for thousands of years.
            Cats have been shown to help people get over their loss more quickly, and show less physical 
            symptoms of pain, like crying. Despite the fact that they are only animals, cats serve as a 
            social support during difficult times. People in mourning report talking to their pet to work
            out their feelings, since it is often easier to talk to something that won’t respond and can’t 
            judge than to another human being.</li>

        <p><li>Rabbits are much more than the cute, carrot-munching creatures pop culture makes them out to be.
            Rabbits are ground dwellers that live in environments ranging from desert to tropical forest and wetland.
            Their natural geographic range in the Western Hemisphere encompasses the middle latitudes. In the Eastern 
            Hemisphere rabbits are found in Europe, portions of Central and Southern Africa, the Indian subcontinent,
            Sumatra, and Japan
